# Progress Tracker Skill

Monitors TodoWrite task completion and synchronizes progress to GitHub Issues.

## What This Skill Does

- **Detects TodoWrite completion**: When tasks are marked complete
- **Updates GitHub**: Posts progress comments via `gh-progress-sync.sh`
- **Auto-closes Issues**: When all tasks are complete (if enabled)

## When to Use

This skill activates when:
- **Explicit sync request**: "sync Issue progress"
- **Status check**: "show Issue #42 status"
- **Task completion**: After marking TodoWrite tasks complete

Explicit invocation: **"use progress-tracker skill to sync Issue #42"**

## How It Works

### Step 1: Calculate Progress
```bash
# Count TodoWrite states
total_tasks = (count all TodoWrite items)
completed_tasks = (count completed items)
percentage = (completed / total) * 100
```

### Step 2: Update GitHub
```bash
# Use gh-progress-sync.sh
echo '{"issue": 42, "completed": [1,2,3], "total": 5, "task_name": "Task name"}' | gh-progress-sync.sh

# Or check specific task
gh-progress-sync.sh --check-task 42 "Task description"
```

### Step 3: Auto-Close (Optional)
```bash
if completed_tasks == total_tasks:
    gh issue comment 42 --body "All tasks completed!"
    gh issue close 42 --reason "completed"
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Manual Sync
```
User: "Sync progress for Issue #42"

Claude:
  1. Reads current TodoWrite state
  2. Calculates: 3/5 tasks (60%)
  3. Runs: echo '{"issue": 42, ...}' | gh-progress-sync.sh
  4. Reports: "Synced Issue #42: 3/5 tasks complete (60%)"
```

### Example 2: Auto-Close on Completion
```
User: (Marks final task as complete)

Claude:
  1. Detects last task completion
  2. Calculates: 5/5 tasks (100%)
  3. Posts completion comment
  4. Closes Issue #42

Output: "All tasks complete! Issue #42 closed."
```

## Scripts

- `~/.local/bin/gh-progress-sync.sh` - GitHub sync utility

## Dependencies

- `gh` CLI (GitHub CLI)
- `jq` (JSON parsing)
- TodoWrite tool

## Best Practices

- Let progress updates happen after task completion
- Use `/gh:start` for full workflow integration
- Complete work within single session when possible

## Limitations

- **Single-direction**: TodoWrite → GitHub only
- **No reverse sync**: GitHub changes don't update TodoWrite
- **GitHub dependency**: Requires network access
