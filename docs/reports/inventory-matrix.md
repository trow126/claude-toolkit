# Phase 1 element inventory and 11-axis audit

Canonical machine-readable source: [`inventory-elements.tsv`](inventory-elements.tsv). Baseline is git commit `7d193c2`; after is the current tree. Each row is one independently identifiable operational element. `before_path` and `after_path` are used by `measure-metrics.sh` to count active review/progress/retrospective mechanisms and built-in-agent overlaps without grouping unlike elements.

The columns map directly to the requirement’s eleven axes: purpose; needed; built-in alternative; overlap; context load; false-positive risk; failure impact; verification; low-cost-model suitability; deterministic replacement; disposition. `archive_path` is evidence only and is never counted as active.

## Metric definitions

- **review/progress/retrospective mechanism**: an active agent, skill, hook, or helper whose primary purpose is generic plan/code/PR review, work-progress recording, or retrospective. Domain-specific implementation specialists are excluded; generic `code-reviewer` and the former generic `security-reviewer` are included. Counts are unique active paths.
- **built-in overlap**: a custom agent whose primary value is generic work/routing already covered by built-in general-purpose/orchestration plus model-tier selection. Counts are unique active paths.
- **session injection**: static always-on instructions plus the measured `SessionStart.systemMessage`; `PostCompact.systemMessage` is reported separately. Auto memory is disabled.
- **audit cardinality**: every row in the TSV represents one distinct operational file or independently configured mechanism. Validation/test scripts are individual rows rather than one grouped “test suite” row.
